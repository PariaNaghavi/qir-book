# qir-book

To build the docs locally, create a python environment with either the conda `environment.yml` or the `requirements.txt`.
Then run `jupyter-book build ./qir-book` from the root of the project and it should run the notebooks and build the html version of the book that you can view from `./qir-book/_build/html/index.html`.
