The QIR ecosystem aims to provide interoperability for hybrid computation in the quantum computing field. It operates as a compiler system with front-end, middle end, and back-end abstraction layers to transform source code into target-machine code. It leverages the LLVM technologies and multi-level IR (MLIR) approach to facilitate compilation for different high-level code and low-level targets. Modern compilers take advantage of introducing new layers of abstraction in the middle end, dissolving traditional compiler phases. This new approach creates MLIR compiler systems. Tools and components that lower the instruction with MLIR approach can be reused for different source code and target machines. It was initially introduced for in machine learning workflows to facilitate compilation for co-processing. MLIR spans the abstraction levels from after source code to machine code generation, creating a space for compiler extensibility and reusability with different high-level languages and low-level targets.
